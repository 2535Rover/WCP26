This directory contains a program which runs MGS on a virtual world with simulated LIDAR.

This is a simplified model to allow for the development of the MGS implementation for the real rover.

# Ubuntu Installation Instructions

  1. Install SDL2 with `apt install libsdl2-dev`.
  2. Install the OpenGL development libraries with `apt install libgl1-mesa-dev` (this one might already be installed, but it doesn't hurt to check!).
